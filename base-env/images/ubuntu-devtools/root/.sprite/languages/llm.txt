Ubuntu DevTools Container Documentation
=======================================================

This container provides a clean Ubuntu 25.04 development environment
with experimental filesystem architecture for experimentation.

FILESYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
========================

This system uses a dual-layer storage approach:

/data/ - DURABLE FILESYSTEM
- Backed by object storage
- Data persists across container restarts and deployments
- Use this for important files, projects, and persistent data
- Recommended for: source code, databases, configuration files

/ (Root) - EXPERIMENTAL OVERLAY
- Uses experimental overlay setup with top layer backed by object storage
- Semi-durable: changes may persist but not guaranteed
- Top layer modifications are stored in object storage
- Consider this experimental and potentially volatile
- Use for: temporary files, system experiments, reproducible package installations

STORAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
=======================

Store persistent data in /data/:
  mkdir -p /data/projects
  cd /data/projects
  git clone <your-repo>

System experiments in /:
  sudo apt install <experimental-package>
  # Changes may persist but treat as temporary

USER CONFIGURATION
==================

User: sprite
- Full passwordless sudo access via sudoers configuration
- Home directory: /home/sprite (on experimental overlay)
- Default shell: /bin/bash
- Member of sudo group

Sudo Access:
- No password required for any sudo command
- Can install packages: sudo apt install <package>
- Can modify system files: sudo nano /etc/hosts
- Can become root: sudo -s
- Can run any privileged command without authentication

SYSTEM TOOLS
============

Pre-installed tools:
- build-essential (gcc, make, libc6-dev, etc.)
- git (distributed version control)
- curl (data transfer tool)
- sudo (privilege escalation)

USAGE PATTERNS
==============

For persistent work:
  cd /data
  # Your work here will survive container lifecycle

For system experimentation:
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install <experimental-tools>
  # May persist but not guaranteed - use /data for important results

IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

1. /data/ is your safe space for persistent storage
2. / overlay is experimental - backup important system changes to /data/
3. sprite user has unrestricted system access via sudo
4. This environment is designed for rapid iteration
5. Always consider data durability when choosing storage location
