This is a server app, always modeled with TLA+ before implementation.

The TLA+ spec is in `./spec/`, start with `./spec/sprite_env.tla`. The implementation is in `./server/`.

When working on this project, implementation should ONLY happen with `./server/` as the working directory. Work on implementation MUST be isolated from modeling work. 

There are various commands in the top level Makefile for verifying our model and verifying scenarios our model expects.
