- NEVER use mutexes for synchronization
- Use clean, channel based communications instead of locking
- When working in packages/**, ONLY work on one package at a time. Make sure tests pass before you move on
- NEVER cancel contexts when things are working like they're supposed to
- ALWAYS write the simplest possible clean, idiomatic golang
- ALWAYS use make test to run tests, NEVER run go test directly
