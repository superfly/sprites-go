Summary of changes needed for lifecycle_test.go:

1. Add "time" import
2. Add 30-second deadline to each test
3. Fix TestStopIsIdempotent to avoid race condition:
   - Add startDone channel
   - Wait 50ms for Start() to begin
   - Wait for Start() goroutine to complete

Key fix for TestStopIsIdempotent:
- The test was starting jfs.Start() in a goroutine without synchronization
- Then immediately calling Stop() which created a race condition
- Solution: Add channel to track Start() completion and wait briefly for it to begin
